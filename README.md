# QGIS Sound Effects Plugin

This plugin plays sound effects when certain actions are performed in QGIS.
After installation, add the **Sound Effects toolbar** to your workspace to control the plugin.

It is currently only possible to enable or disable the plugin. The plugin is enabled by default.

After enabling the plugin, the following actions will trigger sound effects:

- **Success**: When a processing algorithm completes successfully.
- **Fail**: When a processing algorithm fails.
