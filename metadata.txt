    2024-07-23 Version 0.2.2:
        - bug fix:
            - Fixed non-zoom canvas events from not being triggered off on global disable
    2024-07-15 Version 0.2.1:
        - bug fixes:
            - Fixed canvas events to trigger when the global "enable" was False
            - Fixed processing events to ignore their specific "enable" setting
        - Changed default config for `layersChanged` to False
        - connected the `Cancel` button to actually closing the settigns dialog (it was just for show until now apperantly)
        - Added the sad_trombone sound effect (Highly Recommended for when things go wrong)
    2024-07-15 Version 0.2:
        - Added 12 new sound effects
        - Added the following canvas events:
            - Zoom in
            - Zoom out
            - Layers changed (added or removed (I know, we'll get to separate events for each))
            - Render Complete (for when your QGIS is stuck and you need to know when it's done rendering)
            - Render Error (for when your QGIS is stuck and you need to know *if* it's going to make it)
        - Added a settings dialog that allows control over:
            - Which sound effect will be used for each event
            - Toggle whether to play sound effects for each event
            - The volume of the sound effects
        - Added a processing provider and a `Play Sound Effect` algorithm, usefull for adding sound effects to your processing scripts and models
